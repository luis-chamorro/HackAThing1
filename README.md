## Hack A Thing

#### Luis Chamorro

For the first Hack a Thing assignment, I learned React and React Native. I created a simple application which displays a list of movies with their rating and release date.

To run this application, first download the "Expo Client" app on an Android device or iOS device (This process is a lot easier if you have an android device).  
 If you have an android device, then once you have the app downloaded, visit https://expo.io/@luischamorroc/HackAThing1. In this website, you will see a QR code. Scan the QR code with your device and it will automatically open the app.

If you do not have an Android device, you can also open the app on an iOS device. This is, however, slightly more complicated. Apple does not allow you to open the app with the QR code unless you are signed in as the creator of the app. So, in order to be able to use the app, you will need to sign in to Expo on the iOS app. The email for the account is `TestEmailForHackAThing1@gmail.com` and the password is `this_is_a_test`. Once you have done that, you can scan the QR code at https://expo.io/@luischamorroc/HackAThing1 and it should work perfectly.
